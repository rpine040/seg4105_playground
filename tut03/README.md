## Podcast Summary

In the podcast, Jason Fried and David Hansson answer questions and discuss how to ‘write a pitch’ which is a central concept to their development approach “Shape Up.” They describe what exactly a pitch is, and what it does in terms of guiding the process of a product’s development. A pitch is a document that describes and outlines a feature that can be added to a product. It also makes the problems that the feature will fix apparent, and does not include excessive details, instead giving an outline of what to do.

They also delve into the importance of autonomy and purpose in the process of work when it comes to pitches, emphasizing how pitches help focus on the most important aspect of the project. Terms for problems are also used, such as ‘rabbit holes’ and ‘science projects’, which represent situations where excessive work is devoted to minor details, and ambitious endeavors with uncertain outcomes respectively.

They also talk about ‘tracer bullets’ which help to explore and gain insights into challenging projects, before actually putting resources into it. They then layout the topic for the next podcast, talking about ‘betting tables’.
