## Chapter 2 Summary

When Shaping up you must focus on the most important features without going too in-depth. It is also important to avoid leaving out important details though, as leaning too far in either direction or else you risk potential errors within the project, such as making the wrong product due to missing plan details. Shaping allows you to avoid all these by creating a clear plan outline that includes the necessary information. The problem itself is defined properly, which allows for elements of a solution to be created, and then supplementary information such as risks, constraints, limitations/feasibility are all scoped out for the project to progress successfully.

## Chapter 3 Summary

Setting boundaries is the first step in shaping work. This involves defining the scope and constraints of a potential project. It's essential to determine the project's appetite, which sets the time budget for the work, indicating whether it's a small batch (1-2 weeks) or a big batch (6 weeks). The principle of "fixed time, variable scope" guides the process, where the time constraint forces decisions on project scope. It's crucial to recognize that "good" solutions depend on these constraints. When responding to raw ideas, the default response should be a soft "no" until the idea is thoroughly explored and understood. Narrowing down the problem and understanding the specific pain points or use cases is critical, as it helps define a solution within the set appetite and avoid vague or overly broad project proposals, known as "grab-bags." Once these boundaries are in place, the next step is to outline the elements of a solution.

The first step in Shaping work is writing boundaries by defining the scope of the project. You areable to determine the chunks of time for the work to be bound in, called the project's "appetite". Fixed Time Variable Scope (FTCS) is an imporant concet, as it forces decisions to be made within the allotted time, allowing for priorities to be shifted and for features to be put on hold due to the limited time. It is important to allow new ideas to be explored first before being given a green light. Pain points and uses cases are vert important, as this allows for the designing of a solution within the project constraints and time, finishing the bonudaries. 

## Chapter 4 Summary

Moving from cenceptual plan ideas to properly defined elements of the project solution is the next step. In order for work between colleages to progress properly, techniques such as "breadboarding" and "fat marker sketching" are used.

Breadboarding outlines the interactions of componenets to properly build the solution without laying out concrete plans which may limit ideas. Words are used to represent places, affordances, and connections lines in order for new ideas to be explored.

Fat marker forces the planners to only focus on the most important parts of the design due to the thick marker taking up space and not allowing for detailed writing. It focuses on the way the elements are arranged instead.

This entire step focuses on refining ideas, finding challenges before ideas and solutions are underway.

## Chapter 5 Summary

When Shaping for a fixed time, it is important to eliminate the possibility of pitfalls that are present with the ideas for the project solution. Any elements may encounter problems, regardless of how much research and preparation are done beforehand. These issues may cause deadlines to be missed, budgets costs to go too high, and may even lead to the project being abandonned. 

By making the project "hole free", you are able to eliminate these potential possibilities. By identifiying and making steps to address theses holes/"rabbit holes", unknowns, and design challenges, you are able to eliminate the prossibilities of the project going overboard on any of the previously mentioned issues. It is also imporant to properly scope use cases and features so that unnecessary ones are eliminated before work is done on them. Seeking out technical advice from experts may also allow for assumptions to be safely taken if they sign off on them. All these steps allow the project to be risk free, which can then be communicated to stakeholders via pitch documents, allowing for proper resources.
