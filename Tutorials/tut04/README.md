## Chapter 7

Chapter 7 talks about an alternative way to manage tasks and ideas without backlogs, called "Betting Table". This is where stakeholders come together on six-week cycles to decide which pitches they will work on. This helps keep the number of options to be considered small, allowing for shorter and more productive meetings. The decentralized nature of this method also lets teams track their ideas independently, creating ongoing talks about what to prioritize. It also emphasizes context-rich decision-making, meaking sure that important ideas come back naturally while reducing backlog work management.

## Chapter 8 

Chapter 8 talks about having a two-week rest period to reflect on the previous cycle. It involves teams of programmers, QA, and designers working on one project for a whole cycle, or smaller projects throughout. The decision making for "Betting Table" involves the high level stakeholders. The projects or "bets" as they revolve around committing to the "bet, a payout, and potential downsides with a cap. They also emphaisize uninterrupted time for teams to work on the project, handling bugs, and suggesting strategies with the cool-down period. They also bring bugs to the "Betting Table", and bug-fixing cycles. This maximizes flexibility and allows for priority shifting.

## Chapter 9

Chapter 9 talks about how to handle project expectations, which change depending on if you are working on an existing product, or building a new one. Existing products with Shape Up involve shaping the work, making a bet, and then having the team expected to complete it during the cycle.

New products have 3 phases: R&D, Production mode, and Clean-up. R&D involves experimentation and introducing new key pieces to the product idea without immediate expectations to ship. Production mode involves clear shaping and shipping goals, similarly to working on an existing product. Clean-up, which happens right before product launch, prioritizes addressing unexpected issues and making final decisions.

It is also important to have the right questions considered when betting on projects. The importance of the problem, the appetite for the solution, attractiveness, timing, and availability of memmbers. Afterwards, a kick-off message can be sent informing the team of selected projects, and their core teams.
