## Brainstorming

Project Manager vs Product Owner vs Product Manager

Similar titles that have similar responsibilities, but have slight differences that make them often confused for each other

Scrum Master and Project Manager are often confused with each other by Developers, as they both oversee work done, and Scrum Masters are very common with Agile and Scrum work being widespread.

Project Managers are much more varied and cover a wider array of group overseeing compared to Scrum Masters which is a much more narrow role.

### Project manager
- Applies critical thinking skills for decision-making
- Leverages problem-solving techniques for issue resolution
- Uses analytical skills for risk detection and mitigation
- Effectively communicates project/team performance to leadership
- Manages project team and stakeholder expectations

### Scrum master
- Clearly presents scrum/agile concepts through teaching and coaching methods
- Leverages facilitation techniques during scrum events/meetings
- Selects situational coaching stance to use with individuals or teams
- Identifies when to use experiments for learning and solutioning
- Promotes a positive culture by creating a safe space
