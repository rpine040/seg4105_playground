## Notes on Pitches

### Dillon 
Reasonable to implement, but the actual benefits may be too small to consider the work require to implement this feature. There is no need to add this feature, even if the timeframe is a bit generous for the work.

### Daniel
Reasonable timeframe, and the work seems possible with the current tickets planned by each member. Also is an important feature for us to include, as it give much more information to the client.

### Cadence
Not as necessary at this point in the project, but the timeframe is reasonable. The need for an email system is a much lower priority as discussed by the group

### Thuy-vi
The solution does not seem as feasible as other options. It would be the same as implementing our own version of a current application that is easy enough to include without much change to the current project.

### Farina
A nice feature to have added, but there are many unknowns that make the timeframe potentially wildly small. Adding a whole new scope to the project could result in extreme delays to the feature and project as a whole.
